Assignments – Perception, Segmentation, and Planning

This repository contains two independent assignments focused on semantic segmentation, 3D perception, and planning, using both point cloud and RGB image datasets.

2.1 Point Cloud Segmentation and Planning (Toronto-3D)

This assignment focuses on semantic understanding and planning in urban 3D environments using the Toronto-3D LiDAR dataset



2.2 Semantic Segmentation of Forest Images

This assignment demonstrates understanding of deep learning, statistics, and perception through RGB image segmentation.
